# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project actually helped me refine my data analysis and manipulation skills.
I had to fill lots of null values for age as well as decide what to do with null values with Cabin. 
Because majority of Cabin was null I decided to simply get rid of it, but for age, I filled the data
by finding the mean age based on the passengers title and class. I learned to take all string values and turn
them into int values which could be used for model prediction. Overall, RandomForests had the highest precition
with an accuracy of 83.8%.
